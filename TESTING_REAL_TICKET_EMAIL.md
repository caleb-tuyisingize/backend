# Testing Real Ticket Email Confirmation

## Problem Identified
The test email was working, but real bookings weren't sending emails because:
- **Test script** uses a direct email function call ✅
- **Real bookings** use the `/api/seats/book-seats` endpoint ❌ (didn't have email integration)

## Solution Applied
Added email confirmation to **ALL** ticket booking endpoints:
1. ✅ `/api/payments/book-ticket` (paymentController) - Already had it
2. ✅ `/api/seats/book-seats` (seatController.bookSeatsWithConcurrencySafety) - **ADDED NOW**
3. ✅ `/api/seats/:scheduleId/book` (seatController.bookSeat) - **ADDED NOW**

## Files Modified
- `controllers/seatController.js` - Added email service import and email sending after successful bookings

## How to Test Real Booking

### Option 1: Test via Frontend App
1. **Start the backend server** (if not running):
   ```bash
   cd x:\new_safaritix\backend_v2
   npm start
   ```

2. **Make a real booking** through your app:
   - Login as a commuter (e.g., micomyizaa742@gmail.com)
   - Search for a bus schedule
   - Select seats
   - Complete the booking

3. **Check email inbox** at the user's registered email (micomyizaa742@gmail.com)

### Option 2: Test via API (Postman/cURL)

**Step 1: Login to get token**
```bash
POST https://backend-7cxc.onrender.com/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "micomyizaa742@gmail.com",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

**Step 2: Book seats**
```bash
POST https://backend-7cxc.onrender.com/api/seats/book-seats
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "scheduleId": "some-schedule-uuid",
  "busId": "some-bus-uuid",
  "seatNumbers": ["A1", "A2"],
  "pricePerSeat": 5000
}
```

**Step 3: Check email**
- Email should arrive at micomyizaa742@gmail.com

## What to Look For

### In Server Console:
```
✅ Ticket confirmation email sent to micomyizaa742@gmail.com
```

Or if there's an issue:
```
❌ Failed to send ticket confirmation email (non-blocking): [error details]
```

### In User's Email Inbox:
- **Subject**: "🎫 Your SafariTix Ticket Confirmation - X Seat(s)"
- **From**: SafariTix - Bus Booking <laurentniyigena1@gmail.com>
- **Contains**:
  - Trip details (route, departure time)
  - Seat numbers
  - Booking references
  - Price information
  - Professional HTML formatting

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received?

1. **Check server console** for email sending logs
2. **Check user has valid email** in database:
   ```bash
   node scripts/find-user-by-email.js micomyizaa742
   ```
3. **Check spam/junk folder**
4. **Verify SMTP is configured**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-email-service.js
   ```

### Common Issues:

- **"User not found for email notification"** → User ID not found in database
- **"Cannot send ticket email: User email is missing"** → User profile has no email
- **Email transporter error** → Check SMTP credentials in `.env`

## Important Notes

- ✅ **Non-blocking**: Email failures won't cancel the booking
- ✅ **Automatic**: Uses email from user's profile automatically
- ✅ **All endpoints covered**: Works for all booking methods
- ✅ **Rich content**: HTML email with trip details and formatting

## Next Steps

1. Test with a real booking
2. Verify email arrives
3. Check email content looks good
4. If issues, check server console logs
